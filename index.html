                        <p>One look at Audrey Hepburn and it's hard to deny her physical beauty.</p>
                        <p>If one explores her life further, one finds that her beauty transcends the physical. Her work as a star actress, fashion icon, and dedicated  humanitarian makes her the most beautiful woman of all time.</p>

                      <h2>Star Actress</h2>
                        <p>One sign of Hepburn's level of beauty is her success as an actress during the Golden Age of Hollywood. During a time when actresses such as Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner, and Jean Simmons were renowned in the industry, Hepburn was able to hold her own with a unique beauty often described as elfin, waif-like, and wistful adorned by an elegant personality.</p>
                        <p>Hepburn's success as an actress is shown by the multiple awards she received throughout her acting career:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1954: Academy Award for Best Actress.</li>
                            <li>1954: Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama.</li>
                            <li>1954: BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role.</li>
                            <li>1954: Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.</li>
                            <li>1955: Golden Globe for World Film Favorite – Female.</li>
                            <li>1960: Second BAFTA Award.</li>
                            <li>1965: Third BAFTA Award.</li>
                            <li>1993: Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement (Posthumous).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As a testament to her acting skills, one will note above that in 1954 Hepburn won an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA award all for a single performance (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia page for the movie Roman Holiday">Roman Holiday</a>), making her the first actress to do so.</p>

                      <h2>Fashion Icon</h2>
                      <p>Another reason Audrey is the most beautiful woman of all time is her influence on modern fashion.</p>
                      <p>Although her influence on fashion started back in 1961 when she won a spot in the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame, the fashion industry still considers her a fashion icon today.</p>

                      <h2>Dedicated Humanitarian</h2>
                      <p>Audrey's beauty is best exemplified by the dedication of her later years to helping impoverished children from all over the world. From 1988 to 1992, Audrey, with UNICEF, helped children in over twenty countries including Ethiopia, Turkey, and Venezuela.</p>
                      <p>Her humanitarian missions included getting food to orphanages, helping with immunization campaigns, and collaborating with governments on clean water programs.</p>
                      <p>In her short four year career as a humanitarian, her positive impact to the world won her many noteworthy achievements and awards that are listed below:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>1989: Appointed Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF.</li>
                        <li>1992: Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</li>

                        <p>She had a great career as an actress, but I think she will be remembered just as much as a humanitarian, and that's the beauty of her years with UNICEF: She was an inspiration, she brought enormous world attention to children, she raised the profile of the challenges they face.</p>
